# HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

The sole purpose of this task is to adapt both the HTML and CSS files to ensure the following have been implemented:

- Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code

- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

- Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes

- Heading attributes fall in sequential order

- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

## Client Brief
